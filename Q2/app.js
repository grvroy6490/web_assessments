/* 

You are tasked with building a simple web application that fetches user data from an API when a button is clicked. 
Upon receiving the data, the application should display the user's name and email address on the webpage. 
The API endpoint for fetching user data is “https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{userId}” where {userId} is the ID of the user to fetch.

Write the JavaScript code to implement this functionality. Ensure that:

When the button is clicked, the application fetches user data asynchronously from the API.
The user's name and email address are displayed on the web page once the data is fetched.
Handle any errors that may occur during the fetching process, such as network errors or invalid responses from the API.
